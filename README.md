# Java-Linear-Equations-Calculator
A Java console application that calculates a certain type of linear equation based on two points from a line, or can convert one type of linear equation to another. 
# Running the Program
To run this program, create a new project in your Java IDE, create new classes with the same name as the ones in this repository, and insert the code. Then, run linearEquations.java to see the program. 
#Fixes
The program works well, but there are still some small things I'm trying to fix, like making sure ints aren't displayed as floats.
