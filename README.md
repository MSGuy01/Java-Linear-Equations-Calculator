# Java-Linear-Equations-Calculator
A Java console application that calculates a certain type of linear equation based on two points from a line, or can convert one type of linear equation to another. 
# Running the Program
To run this program, add all the class files and the run.bat file to a folder on your computer. Make sure you have Java installed to your PATH, and then run the run.bat file. This only works on Windows. If you have another OS, you can just copy the code from the java files into your IDE, and run them there.
# Fixes
The program works well, but there are still some small things I'm trying to fix, like making sure ints aren't displayed as floats.
